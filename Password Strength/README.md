py Password_Strength.py
```
4. Enter the password you want to estimate the cracking time for.

## Features
- Estimates the password length and number of possible combinations.

- Calculates the estimated number of guesses required to crack the password, assuming 1 billion guesses per second.

- Estimates the time required to crack the password in years, days, hours, minutes, or seconds.

- Provides feedback on the strength of the password (weak, medium, or strong) based on its length and complexity.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No additional libraries or dependencies required.
