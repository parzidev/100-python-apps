## ***Rock-Paper-Scissors Game with User Input and Score Tracking in Python***


![image](https://github.com/parzivalhaliday/100-python-apps/blob/main/rockpaperscissors/image.png)


The code implements a simple rock-paper-scissors game between the user and the computer. It asks the user for their nickname and then enters into a loop that plays rounds of the game until the user chooses to stop. Each round of the game, the user inputs their choice (rock, paper, or scissors) and the computer randomly generates its own choice. The program then determines the winner of the round and updates the score accordingly. After each round, the program displays the current score and asks the user if they want to play again.

Once the user chooses to stop playing, the program determines the winner of the game based on the total score and displays a final message with the results. The program also includes error handling for invalid user inputs and includes comments to explain each part of the code.

Overall, this code is designed to be a simple, interactive game that allows users to play rock-paper-scissors against the computer and keep track of their score.



## To run this code in Visual Studio Code, you can follow these steps:


1. Open Visual Studio Code and create a new Python file by clicking on "File" > "New File".

2. Copy and paste the code into the new file.

3. Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `rps_game.py`.

4. Open the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code by clicking on "Terminal" > "New Terminal".

5. Navigate to the directory where the Python file is saved using the `cd` command. For example, if the file is saved on your desktop, you can navigate to the desktop directory by typing `cd Desktop` in the terminal.

6. Once you're in the correct directory, you can run the Python file by typing `py rps_game.py` in the terminal and pressing Enter.

7. The program will prompt you for your nickname and then begin playing the game. Follow the prompts in the terminal to input your choices and play the game.

8. Once the game is finished, the program will display the final score and a message thanking you for playing.

I hope this helps!
